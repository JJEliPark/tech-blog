## Welcome to My First Blog Post!

This is an exciting journey into the world of **tech blogging**. Here's what we'll cover in this post:

- The reason behind starting this blog.
- The technology used to create this blog.
- What's coming next.

### Why Start This Blog?

I wanted to create a platform to share knowledge and ideas about technology, development practices, and cool projects. This blog will serve as that platform!

### The Technology Stack

This blog is built using:

- **Next.js**: For the framework.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting the blog.
- **Markdown**: Writing the posts easily.

Hereâ€™s some code as an example:

```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```
